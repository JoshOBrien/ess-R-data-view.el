* Introduction
  ess-R-data-view is a data viewer for GNU R. It shows dataframes and matrices in table view.

* Usage 
  Place cursor on a word that indicate dataframe or matrix and then do  =M-x ess-R-dv-ctable= or =M-x ess-R-dv-pprint=
  which will popup another buffer containing the table.

  If the word is not a dataframe or matrix, an error message will pop up.

  =ess-R-dv-ctable= and =ess-R-dv-pprint= have different features. 
  
  The first, =ess-R-dv-ctable=, shows table in another buffer. It includes a border and a fixed header.

  The second, =ess-R-dv-pprint=, shows pretty-printed text in another buffer. It shows huge text smoothly.

* Note
  ess-R-data-view uses another buffer, so it influences window layout. If you keep windows layout, you had better install window manager. popwin.el and e2wm.el is useful.
